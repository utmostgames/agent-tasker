# AGENTS.md

**STOP. READ CLAUDE.md BEFORE DOING ANYTHING.**

Every agent entering this project — orchestrator, dev worker, test worker, or any other instance — MUST read and internalize `CLAUDE.md` in its entirety before taking any action whatsoever. No exceptions.

Do NOT:
- Start writing code
- Modify any file
- Run any command
- Respond to any prompt

...until you have read `CLAUDE.md` and confirmed you understand the orchestration rules, status transitions, worker identity requirements, and task lifecycle.

**CLAUDE.md is the law of this project. Follow it exactly.**
